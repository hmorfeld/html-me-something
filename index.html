    <p>Oversized Scrunchies are one of my favortie trends for Spring. You can wear them in your hair or on your wrist. 
    They come in a varitey of materials like satin, organza, or velvet. 
    They are priced anywhere from $3 to $50 depending on if they are desinger or not. or you can make your own for about $5!

    <p>I'm not a big headband person, but if I was, I would wear one of these! They are a spin off last year's padded headbands, just with a little more detail to them.
    You can wear a braided headband with any kind of outfit! Throw it on with a casul shirt and jeans to spice things up or complete your date night outfit with a braided headband in satin!
    Got a zoom meeting in 5 mins but just rolled out of bed? No problem, braided headband! You can get a handmade one on etsy for around $10 or a lot of national chain retailers like F21 and H&M have them for under $20.
