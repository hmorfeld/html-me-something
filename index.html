                    <p>Oversized Scrunchies are one of my favortie trends for Spring. You can wear them in your hair or on your wrist. 
                    They come in a varitey of materials like satin, organza, or velvet. 
                    They are priced anywhere from $3 to $50 depending on if they are desinger or not. or you can make your own for about $5!

                    <p>I'm not a big headband person, but if I was, I would wear one of these! They are a spin off last year's padded headbands, just with a little more detail to them.
                        You can wear a braided headband with any kind of outfit! Throw it on with a casul shirt and jeans to spice things up or complete your date night outfit with a braided headband in satin!
                        Got a zoom meeting in 5 mins but just rolled out of bed? No problem, braided headband! You can get a handmade one on etsy for around $10 or a lot of national chain retailers like F21 and H&M have them for under $20.

                    <p>Also referred to as barrettes, the large hair clip is a perfect accessory for spring, or really all year round! 
                        These clips come in every shape, size and color imaginable. 
                        They often include embellishments like pearls, glitter or rhinestones. 
                        You can wear your hair a ton of different ways with these hair clips too! 
                        These are relatively inexpensive accessories as well, ranging anywhere from $2 - $15. 
                        However, some designer barrettes can be as expensive as $200!

                    <p>Lastly, we have the hair scarf. What was once a 1950’s trend that made its way through the decades of fashion until it halted in the early 2000s is now back! Often made of silk, cotton, satin or a poly-satin blend, we saw the hair scarf emerge from the time capsule and become a late summer staple last year and the trend continues as the temperatures warm up in 2021. 
                    Hair scarves can range in price anywhere from $12 all the way up to the hundreds depending on the fabric and designer.
